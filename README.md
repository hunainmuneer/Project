## Description
This project aims to analyze the housing crisis in Canada. The project will include various factors that can have an impact on housing prices such as interest rates, population growth, supply and demand, etc... Since the news is stating that the unaffordable housing is due to the increase in the number of people in Canada, we will start exploring the relationship between house prices and the number of immigrants. The analysis is based on data obtained from the Government of Canada's open data portal, focusing on house prices and immigrant population statistics.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (or Python script) containing the analysis.
4. Execute the code cells to perform the analysis and visualize the results.

## Data
This analysis utilizes two datasets downloaded from Government of Canada's open data portal, related to the housing crisis in Canada. Please download the following datasets and place them in the appropriate directory:
1. **Immigrant Population Data**: The dataset containing information on the number of immigrants in various regions of Canada is also sourced from [immigrant-status-and-period-of-immigration-e](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/9adddd8a-e15b-497c-86af-641457a78bea/resource/255012de-7f8a-4f5e-b62a-bc438dc89543)
2. **House Prices Data**: The dataset containing information on house prices across different regions in Canada is sourced from [New housing price index, monthly](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/324befd1-893b-42e6-bece-6d30af3dd9f1)

## Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:
- Data collection
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical analysis

## Results
The key findings from the analysis will be summarized here.

## Future Work
Potential future enhancements or additional analyses for this project may include:
